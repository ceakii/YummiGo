        Ingredients

        Tri-Color Pasta Salad
        • 1 lb tri-color rotini pasta
        • 3 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
        • 1 lb mini mozzarella balls (or mozzarella pearls)
        • 7 oz jar oil-packed chopped sun-dried tomatoes, removed and drained from the oil

        Spinach Basil Pasta Sauce
        • 6 oz bag baby spinach
        • 1 packed cup fresh basil leaves
        • 1/3 cup olive oil
        • 2 cloves garlic, sliced
        • 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
        • 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
        • 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
        • Salt
        • Pepper

        
        
        Directions

        1. Prepare a bowl of ice water.

        2. Bring 4-6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, add the spinach and basil and blanch for 30 seconds until the greens are vibrant.

        3. Immediately transfer the greens to the ice water using a slotted spoon. Set aside.

        4. In the same pot of boiling water, add 1 tbsp of salt. Then, add the rotini pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 

        5. Drain the pasta in a colander and run it under cold water for about a minute until the pasta is completely cooled. Set aside.

        6. While the pasta is cooking, continue to prepare the sauce. Heat the olive oil over low-medium heat in a small frying pan. Cook the garlic and red pepper flakes in the olive oil until the garlic is lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes.
        
        7. Squeeze out most of the excess water from the blanched spinach and basil using your hands.
        
        8. In a food processor fitted with an S blade, combine the blanched spinach and basil, sauteed garlic with red pepper flakes and olive oil, lemon juice, parmesan cheese, and a generous shake of salt and pepper.
        
        9. Blend until the sauce is smooth with no lumps.

        10. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, cherry tomatoes, mini mozzarella balls, sun-dried tomatoes, and the spinach basil sauce

        11. Use mixing spoons to combine everything until the ingredients are all well coated in the sauce.

        12. Serve cold or at room temperature.
