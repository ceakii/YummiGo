        Ingredients

        Roasted Tomatoes
        • 1-1/2 pints (640 grams) cherry tomatoes
        • 2 cloves garlic
        • 6 sprigs thyme
        • 5 tablespoons (65 grams) extra virgin olive oil
        • 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt

        Avocado Toast
        • 3 medium Hass avocados or 2 large Hass avocados
        • 2 tablespoons (8 grams) chopped fresh parsley or equal amount of fresh basil
        • 2 teaspoons (10 grams) fresh queezed lemon juice
        • 5 tablespoons oil reserved from the roasted tomatoes
        • 1-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
        • 4 slices rustic bread or sourdough bread sliced 1/2-inch thick

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Directions

        1. For roasting the tomatoes use a 2-quart baking dish. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

        2. Wash the cherry tomatoes. Slice each clove of garlic into 3 pieces and scatter them on the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange the sprigs of thyme across the bottom the pan.
        
        3. Place the cherry tomatoes in the baking dish on top of the garlic and thyme. Spoon the extra virgin olive oil over the tomatoes. Use your hands or a large spoon to toss the tomatoes and make sure they are coated with the olive oil. Sprinkle the kosher salt over the tomatoes.
        
        4. Roast the tomatoes for 15-20 minutes or until they start to appear wrinkled and some of them have burst open. At the half-way mark (about 8 minutes) stir the tomatoes with large spoon to ensure even cooking.
        
        5. Remove the baking dish from the oven and let the tomatoes cool until they are room temperature. When the tomatoes have cooled spoon some of the liquid (the tomato olive oil mixture) into a small bowl. This olive oil is fragrant with garlic and thyme and will be used to season the avocado mixture.
        
        6. Toast the four slices of bread until light brown. Brush each slice with some of the reserved tomato olive oil mixture.
        
        7. Halve and pit the avocados. Scoop the flesh into a large mixing bowl. Use a large mixing bowl to ensure you have room to mix together the ingredients without knocking anything out the bowl.
        
        8. Add the chopped parsley, 2 teaspoons of lemon juice,1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 2 teaspoons of the roasted tomato olive oil. Mash the ingredients together using a fork and make sure to leave some large chunks. Taste the mixture add more salt and roasted tomato olive oil to taste.
        
        9. Assemble the Tomato Avocado Toast
        
        10. Spread some of the avocado on each slice of toast. Arrange 6-8 tomatoes on top of each slice of toast. Drizzle some of the tomato olive oil on top. Sprinkle the parsley on top. Season with fresh ground pepper.
